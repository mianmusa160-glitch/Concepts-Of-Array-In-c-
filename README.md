# Concepts of Arrays in C#
In C#, an array is a data structure that stores a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type. Arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is always at index 0.<br>
# 1. Single-Dimensional Array (1D)
A 1D array is the simplest form, representing a linear list of items. Think of it as a single row of boxes, where each box has a number (index) and holds a value.

<b>Visual:</b> A single row.

Syntax: type[] arrayName;<br>
# 2. Two-Dimensional Array (2D) 
A 2D array is essentially a matrix or a table with rows and columns. It is defined using a single comma inside the square brackets [,].

<b>Visual:</b> A spreadsheet or a grid.

<b>Syntax:</b> type[,] arrayName;

<b>Analogy:</b> A cinema hall where seats are arranged in rows and columns.\
# 3. Three-Dimensional Array (3D)
A 3D array adds a third dimension: depth (or layers). You can visualize it as a cube, or a stack of 2D matrices (pages in a book). It is defined using two commas [,,].

<b>Visual:</b> A Rubik's cube or a stack of spreadsheets.

<b>Syntax:</b> type[,,] arrayName;

<b>Structure:</b> [Layer, Row, Column]
