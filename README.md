# Concepts of Arrays in C#
In C#, an array is a data structure that stores a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type. Arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is always at index 0.<br>
# 1. Single-Dimensional Array (1D)
A 1D array is the simplest form, representing a linear list of items. Think of it as a single row of boxes, where each box has a number (index) and holds a value.

Visual: A single row.

Syntax: type[] arrayName;

Example: Storing the scores of 5 students.
